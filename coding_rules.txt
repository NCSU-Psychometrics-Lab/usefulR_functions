So this file will be used to show how writing a plain text document can be done 
in the terminal! It's actually really cool, but I'll save it so that I know how 
files work in the github space. 

Cheers,

P.S. keep practicing and keep track, you're making progress!

07/19/19: So, I've learned the command line tool to open a TextEdit document 
instead of writing them out in the terminal. This is FAR easier and more 
efficient. Next, I'll have to learn to open VS Code to update my scripts 
instead of using the text pad. Shouldn't be too big of an issue, right? 
Just document once you have it down here!
